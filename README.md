This is the implementation of ElGamal encryption. It was coded with Xcode on Mac.
All thats needed to run the code is to have crypto++ installed on the host computer and making sure the paths are included when running the project.

The main.cpp is included which includes all the code for getting the text, converting it to ASCII decimal, encrypting and decrypting, and lastly changing the ASCII back to Plaintext.
